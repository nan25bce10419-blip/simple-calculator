1. simple-calculator
I made a project on simple calculator which performs the basic functions like ADDITION , SUBTRACTION , MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION .  I made this project by using user defined functions so it made easy to understand.

3. Overview of the Project
This project is a basic calculator application built using Python.  
It allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  
The program is menu-driven and takes input from the user in an interactive way.

3. Features
- Menu-based user interface  
- Supports addition  
- Supports subtraction  
- Supports multiplication  
- Supports division  
- Handles invalid inputs  
- Prevents division by zero  
- Runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.


4. Technologies / Tools Used
- *Python 3*  
- *VS Code / Any Python IDE*  
- *Command Line / Terminal*

5. Steps to Install & Run the Project
1. Install Python 3 on your system.  
2. Download or clone this repository.  
3. Open the folder in VS Code or any editor.  
4. Run the Python file using the command:  
   python calculator.py
5. Follow the menu shown in the terminal.

6. Instructions for Testing
- Enter any number from the menu (1–5).  
- Provide two numeric inputs when the program asks.  
- Check that the correct result is displayed.  
- Try entering wrong inputs to verify error handling.  
- Test division by zero to see if the program shows a warning.
